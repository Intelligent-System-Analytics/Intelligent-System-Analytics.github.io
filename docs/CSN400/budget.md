## Use Cost Analysis Tool to keep track of your budget consumption

The best way to avoid surprises in how our credit is spent is by carrying out a daily and detailed control of the resources and the cost that each one has. Select your Student Resource Group and under Cost Management find _"Cost Analysis"_. It would look somewhat like the image below, though the Resource Group name would be unique to each individual.
